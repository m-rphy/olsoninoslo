- 👋 Hi, I’m @olsoninoslo
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in in back-web development, scientific computiing and AI. I'm not really trained in any of those, this profile documents my journey in teaching myself these broad and deep topics
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript for web development. Earlier this year I was getting my hands dirty with python for scientific computing. I would like to eventually merge the front end frameworks like react and angular with backend frameworks like Node.JS, Flask, Django, and eventually learn some graphQL, but for now I am just practicing with writing functions.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building web tools, scientific computation problems, or anything that happens to spark my interest!
